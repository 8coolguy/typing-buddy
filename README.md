# Type Buddy

This is type buddy. A typing assitant that will watch your hands while you type to ensure that you are typing correctly with the proper form. It will be able to recognize your keyboard layout and determine what keys you are pressing. You will also be able to press set which keys are where on your keyboard.


**Preliminary results from a rule based cv algoritm**
Low accuracy on the finger tip detection good calssification on the keys. will switch to doing a google media pipe solution. maybe learn how to make simple version of it by myself. I can also try doing the convex hull method version of that.
